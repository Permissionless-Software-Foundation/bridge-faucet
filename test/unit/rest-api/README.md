# REST API Unit Tests

The tests in this directory are unit tests of REST API. These tests are not
concerned with the business logic behind the endpoints. They are only concerned
with the handling of the REST API endpoint. These tests answer questions like:

- Is the endpoint responding properly when the business logic throws an error?
- When returning an error, is it returning the proper HTTP response?
- When returning success, is it returning the correct payload?
