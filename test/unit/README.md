# Unit Tests
Unit tests are defined as testing the smallest possible unit of a function. They also do not make any live network calls.

Unit tests are broken up by directory:

- [biz-logic](./biz-logic) tests the business logic libraries.
- [rest-api](./rest-api) tests the REST API specific handling of the router.
- json-rpc (coming soon) tests the JSON-RPC routing using ipfs-coord library.
