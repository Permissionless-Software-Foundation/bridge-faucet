# Business Logic Unit Tests

The unit tests in this directly are concerned with business logic libraries in the /src/lib folder. These are the methods that should be triggered by REST API endpoints. These tests are not concerned with the handling of the REST API request/response, but by the code that is triggered by those endpoints. It also tests any business logic that is not directly associated with a REST API endpoint.
